WATOM
=====

A geek self-hosted alternative to Evernote and a previewer for different markdown languages.

Currently the project is on a proof-of-concept stage.

Installation
============

I'm not sure when this software will be in PYPI, so the easiest and the most reliable way to install this:

    git clone git@github.com:anticodeninja/watom.git
    pip install -e watom


Usage
=====

At this stage only preview of a document is available and can be runned with:

    watom README.md
